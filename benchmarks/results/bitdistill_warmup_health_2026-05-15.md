## Checks

| check | status | evidence | blocker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| warm-up log exists | pass | logs/bitdistill-glue-9894.out |  |
| warm-up has enough observations | pass | observations=1786, required=10 |  |
| step numbers are strictly increasing | pass | first=1, latest=17850, observations=1786 |  |
| CE values are finite | pass | nonfinite=0, latest_ce=4.339255 |  |
| latest progress is within target | pass | latest=17850, max_steps=20000, progress=0.8925 |  |
| log is fresh while job is active | pass | age_seconds=19.6 |  |
| ETA is finite | pass | seconds_per_step=1.8201792717086835, eta_seconds=3913.3854341736696 |  |
| monitor identifies same warm-up job | pass | monitor_job=9894, parsed_job=9894 |  |

| stored script error | - |

## Warnings

| warning |
| --- |
| SAVE_EVERY_STEPS is 0 and no final state exists yet; a job failure would lose current warm-up progress. |
| The running warm-up was submitted from an older batch script than the current checked-in launcher; current future launches have stricter snapshot guards, but this active job retains its submitted script. |
| The active warm-up stored script does not contain the current SAVE_EVERY_STEPS safety guard; this explains the no-snapshot live run and should not be treated as the current launcher policy. |
